# SESL1-Challenge-3

LEVEL 3 CHALLENGE

Hangman

The Level 3 challenge will be more “playful” than in previous challenges: build a game of Hangman. For reference, here is the Wikipedia article that explains how the game works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)

For this project, we want you to:

1. Design a gameplay where the player can play against the computer with a random set of words

2. Display a leaderboard (stored on server side)

3. Ability for the user to set the word for a single session and give the link to somebody else to play it
